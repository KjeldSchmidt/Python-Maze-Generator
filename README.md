# Python-Maze-Generator

A simple implementation of the common backtracking maze generator algorithm. Runs in Python3 and standard libraries, notably PIL.  
Every maze is fully connected and acyclic and can therefore be solved/fully traversed by following the right hand rule.

Some examples, all on a 20x20-Grid:
